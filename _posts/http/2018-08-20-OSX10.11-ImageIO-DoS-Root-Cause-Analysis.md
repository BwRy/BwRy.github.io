Fuzzing the ImageIO Foundation with afl via jpeg2000/jp2/jpc files on OSX 10.11 yielded a unique hang. Note: always disable CrashReporter on OSX or the hang could be caused by it.

I triaged the fuzzed file and fed it to Quicktime (via qlmanage) with the sample[1] tool to determine the function call(s) that were running:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BwRy/bwry.github.io/master/images/qlmanage_sample_callstack.png)

The callstack contains calls to functions starting with kdu_* and jp* which are exported by libJP2.dylib.
After research, its a 3rd-party jpeg2000 library called Kadaku[2], so this is going to be blackbox reverse engineering instead of relying on an open source library that I can run tests against.

I tested it in Safari with a simple html file that contained an image tag pointing to the fuzzed file.
Sure enough, I got the Apple Spinning Beach Ball of Death. Checking the Activity Monitor showed that the com.Apple.WebKit.WebContent process hung.

Now that we know it affects both Quicktime and Safari’s renderer, WebKit, I used dtrace to grab the callstack and filtered out any function calls not a part of ImageIO or libJP2.dylib.
```dtrace -l -n ‘pid<#>:::entry' -p <#> > safProbes.txt```

With Safari’s callstack, I used a handy lldb wrapper (Hopper) to sort out whats what.

I had to run Safari, attach the local debugger, set a breakpoint for main. Once it was hit, I deleted it and set another one for “_AccessHeader”.

The file will be a CGImageRef[3] object. After more debugging, I looked at and set breakpoints on private functions that use that object, particularly “_CGImageSourceBindToPlugin“ and “MakeImagePlus"


From there, I set watchpoints on the bytes of the fuzzed file in rdi:
<image=accessHeader_rdi_watchpoints.png>

It eventually led to the CGIMageRef being used in calls to `CFDataGetBytes(CFDataRef[4] ourFilesBytes, range, buffer);`

<image=hopperCFDataGetBytes.png>

We’re on the right track. From the callstack, eventually CFDataGetBytes leads to calls in LibJP2.dylib to read the box header via libJP2.dylib`jp2_input_box::read_box_header(bool) and then read bytes libJP2.dylib`jp2_input_box::read(uchar*, int)
Then it calls j2_icc_profile_init(*uchar, int, bool):
```j2_icc_profile_init(
	*uchar ptrToOurFileBytes,
	int 

The 1st argument is a pointer to our actual file bytes
